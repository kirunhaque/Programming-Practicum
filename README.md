# Balanced Symbol Checker
A C program that will determine whether input is given with properly balanced symbols. 
We will often use symbols together to specify the beginning and ending of an item, such as the use of parentheses in a
mathematic expression or the use of curly braces in a C, C++ or Java program. For this program, we will be checking the 
following symbol pairs: 
parentheses: ( ) 
Curly braces: { } 
square brackets: []
angle brackets: < >
