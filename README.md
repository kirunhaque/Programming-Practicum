# Balanced Symbol Checker
A C program that will determine whether input is given with properly balanced symbols. 
We will often use symbols together to specify the beginning and ending of an item, such as the use of parentheses in a
mathematic expression or the use of curly braces in a C, C++ or Java program. For this program, we will be checking the 
following symbol pairs: 
* parentheses: ( ) 
* Curly braces: { } 
* square brackets: []
* angle brackets: < >

##Maze Solving ##
C program that will find its way through a maze using the depth-first search algorithm.  
This program takes input from a file where the filename is specified in the command line arguments/
The input file will only containtwo integer values per line of input:
* The first valid line gives the size of the 2-D maze(the number of rows given by the first number, 
then the number of columns given by the second number), valid values are >= 1
* The second valid line gives the coordinates of the starting position in the maze
* The third valid line gives the coordinates of the ending position in the maze
* The remaining valid lines in the file give the coordinates of blocked positions in the maze
