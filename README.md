# Balanced Symbol Checker
A C program that will determine whether input is given with properly balanced symbols. 
We will often use symbols together to specify the beginning and ending of an item, such as the use of parentheses in a
mathematic expression or the use of curly braces in a C, C++ or Java program. For this program, we will be checking the 
following symbol pairs: 
* parentheses: ( ) 
* Curly braces: { } 
* square brackets: []
* angle brackets: < >

## Maze Solving ##
C program that will find its way through a maze using the depth-first search algorithm.  
This program takes input from a file where the filename is specified in the command line arguments/
The input file will only containtwo integer values per line of input:
* The first valid line gives the size of the 2-D maze(the number of rows given by the first number, 
then the number of columns given by the second number), valid values are >= 1
* The second valid line gives the coordinates of the starting position in the maze
* The third valid line gives the coordinates of the ending position in the maze
* The remaining valid lines in the file give the coordinates of blocked positions in the maze 

### Restaurant Waiting List ###

 C program that will implement a customer waiting list that might be used by a restaurant.When people want to be seated in the restaurant, they give their name and group size to the host/hostess and then wait until those in front of them have been seated.  The program mustuse a linked listto implement the queue-like data structure.The linked list is to maintain the following information for each group that is waiting:
 * name (we assume a maximum name length of 30 characters)
 * group size
 * in-restaurant status: whether the group has called ahead or is waiting in the restaurant
 The system does not take reservations for a specific time and date (i.e. table of 4 for 7pm on Saturday), but it will allow for a group   to call ahead and get their name on the waiting list beforethey arrive.
